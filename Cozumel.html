	<img src="media/Cozumel.jpg" style="height:200px;width:300px;"/><br> As you arrive to the terminal, a man wearing large sunglasses holds a sign with your name on it.
	<br>You approach him and ask "What is going on?"</p>
	<p id="page1" class="text_border">He responds, "Aqui esta tu paquete, y buena suerte." and hands over a package before disappearing into the crowd.</p>
	<p id="page1" class="text_border">Inside the package is a map of Cozumel, a pair of car keys, and directions to a diveshop.
	<br>You arrive to the dive shop. 
	<br> <img src="media/diveshop.png" style="height:200px;width:300px;"/></p>
	<br> <p id="page1" class="text_border">The instructions say you must figure out how to complete three dives in a 24 period, including a dive of 80 feet.
	<br> You have never learned to swim, not to mention scuba-dive. <br>And you are aware of the dangers of an air embolism, when one or more gas bubbles enter a vein or artery.
	<br> <img src="media/air_embolism.jpg" style="height:200px;width:300px;/> 
	<br>It can be lethal.</p>

<div id="Back_Out">
	<p class="text_border">You are too afraid of drowning and decide not to back out. You recieve a phone call. A recording tells you your loved one has died."<br> Click <a href="CYOA_intro.html"> here </a> to play again.</p>

	<p class="text_border">You decide to dive, despite your fear of drowning. 
	<br> <img src="media/wave.gif" style="height:200px;width:300px;"/> 
	<br>You try your best to follow the directions of the scuba instructor.
	<br>You first put the tank on the seat and sit down. 
	<br> <img src="media/tanks.jpg" style="height:200px;width:300px;"/> 
	<br> Next, you buckle the Boyuncy Control vest and put the regulator in your mouth.

	<img src="media/regulator.jpg" style="height:200px;width:300px;"/>
	<br>Then, you pull on your fins and mask.
	<br><img src="media/mask.jpg" style="height:200px;width:300px;"/>
	<img src="media/fins.jpg" style="height:200px;width:300px;"/>
	<br>Holding the regulator and mask with one hand, you use your other hand to push backwards into the open water.</p>
	<p class="text_border"><img src="media/water.gif" style="height:200px;width:300px;"/>
	<br>As you descend headfirst into the Palancar Reef, you can see the blue abyss of the ocean.<br>A Bluefin tuna swims past at 45mph, reflecting the light of the sea.
	<br> <img src="media/bluefin.gif" style="height:200px;width:300px;"/>
	<img src="media/tuna.gif" style="height:200px;width:300px;"/>
	<br>The farther down you go, the reef appears darker, and less colorful.
	<br>You can hear yourself breathing. 
	<br><img src="media/giphy.gif" style="height:200px;width:300px;"/>
	<br>Before you realize it, you are already 80 feet deep. The instructor gives you a thumbs-up, a signal to return to the surface.</p>
	<p class="text_border">As you get back into the boat, you are unsure if you can make another dive. The combination of fear and jet lag left you exhausted.
	<br>The instructor reminds you to meet back in two hours for a 50-foot dive.</p>
	<p class="text_border">You fall asleep right there on the sand. 
	<br> <img src="media/sand.gif" style="height:200px;width:300px; />
	<br>The instructor wakes you up, hands you a weight-belt, and says "We are going to Santa Rosa".</p>
	<p class="text_border">You somehow mangage to get up and climb into the Zodiac. 
	<br> The boat moves into the horizon.

	<img src="media/sunsent gif.gif" style="height:200px;width:300px;"/> 
	<br>The instructor throws an anchor into the water and the two of you dive in.</p>
	<p class="text_border">He immediately swims towards the reef. As you approach it, the colors and shape of the Santa Rosa reef become more defined, and the oceans diversity overwhelms you.
